Hi. Hello. Hi. Hello. :)

Collaborator (It's Kristan and I'm the collaborator, and I'm going to make some histograms.)

```{r}
#Loaded tidyverse, read in data
library(tidyverse)
kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

#Made a histogram
kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender)

kermit_hist



```

Creator: Gonna do some rank-based testing 

Is there a sig difference in pre-talk Kermit scores for males and females?

Our data is unpaired so will need to use Mann-Whitney U
```{r}
# Unpaired: Mann-Whitney U

mwu_kermit = kermit %>% 
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data = .)
mwu_kermit # p = 0.4001

```

There is no sig difference for pre and post-talk Kermit scores between males and females.
